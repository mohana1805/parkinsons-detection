Parkinson’s Disease Detection via fusion of speech and spiral features using machine learning

This project focuses on detecting Parkinson’s Disease by combining information from speech signals (audio) and hand-drawn spiral images using advanced ensemble learning techniques.

🚀 Overview
Parkinson’s disease affects both speech patterns and motor control.
To capture this, the system uses a multi-modal approach:

Audio (.wav files) for speech feature extraction
Spiral drawings for image-based feature extraction (HOG)
Fusion models to combine both modalities for final prediction

Methodology
1. Feature Extraction
🎤 Audio Features
Extracted from .wav files
Captures voice impairments such as tremors and instability

Features include:
MFCC (Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients)
Pitch, jitter, shimmer

✍️ Spiral Image Features
Parkinson’s patients often show irregular hand movements
Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) is used to extract shape and texture features

3. Fusion Approaches
🔹 Weighted Averaging
Combines predictions from audio and image models
Uses predefined weights
Serves as a baseline method
🔹 Attention-Based Fusion
Learns the importance of each modality dynamically
Assigns adaptive weights to audio and image features
🔹 Meta-Stacking
Uses outputs of individual models as input features
Trains a meta-learner such as Logistic Regression or XGBoost
Captures complex relationships between predictions
